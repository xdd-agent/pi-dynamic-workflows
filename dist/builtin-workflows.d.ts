/**
 * Shared registry of the 5 curated built-in workflow patterns
 * (`deep-research`, `adversarial-review`, `code-review`, `multi-perspective`,
 * `codebase-audit`).
 *
 * This is the single place that turns a pattern's name + caller-supplied args
 * into a runnable script (and, where a pattern needs it, an exec context such
 * as web tools). Both entry points a model or user can reach a built-in
 * through — the `/deep-research`-style slash commands (builtin-commands.ts)
 * and the `workflow` tool's `name` input (workflow-tool.ts) — resolve through
 * this one registry, so the two paths can never drift apart and the
 * per-pattern generator scripts are written exactly once.
