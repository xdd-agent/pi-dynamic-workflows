/**
 * Auto-resume for runs paused on a provider usage limit.
 *
 * A workflow run pauses (does not fail) when a provider quota/usage limit is hit
 * (see errors.ts PROVIDER_USAGE_LIMIT, workflow-manager.ts executeRun()'s catch
 * block). Left alone, the run just sits there until a human runs /workflows and
 * hits resume. This module watches the manager's public event stream and, for
 * runs that are auto-resume-eligible, arms a timer to call manager.resume() once
 * the provider's quota is likely to have refilled — with exponential backoff if
 * it keeps hitting the wall, and a hard attempt cap so it never retries forever.
 *
 * Deliberately standalone: it consumes ONLY WorkflowManager's public surface
 * (on/off, listAllRuns, resume, getPersistence) so it stays decoupled from
 * manager/persistence internals. It owns its own timers and its own bookkeeping
 * (in-memory, best-effort persisted) — it does not rely on manager.stop(), which
 * only operates on in-memory runs.
