 * This authorizes — it does not force. Arming is a confirmed opt-in signal that
 * lifts the always-on "do not call the tool" gate for THIS message; the model
 * still decides whether the message is actually a request to do work (→ call the
 * `workflow` tool) or just talk about workflows (→ answer directly). The old
 * "You MUST / the ONLY acceptable action / Do NOT answer directly" forcing text
 * caused two bugs: it over-triggered on messages that merely mention workflows
 * (#88), and — by commanding the model to emit nothing but one `workflow` call
 * and not talk — it produced a bare background run that ends the turn and leaves
 * the user at an idle prompt (#89).
 *
 * The banner therefore (1) LEADS with the decision boundary (question/trivial →
 * answer directly; a real decomposable request → call `workflow`) rather than
 * leading with "call the tool"; (2) states the truthful opt-in `reason` for THIS
 * path (no "the word you typed" on the effort path, where none was); and (3)
 * carries the #89 background/deliver-back reassurance so an ending turn reads as
 * expected. The how-to mechanics are NOT here — they live in the tool's static
 * `description` (see createWorkflowTool), visible whenever the model looks at the
 * tool, so they aren't re-injected per armed turn (#65).
 *
 * `extraDirective` (e.g. an effort-tier nudge + EFFORT_CONVERSATIONAL_ESCAPE) is
 * appended when present.
