/**
 * Shared filesystem primitives for JSON-backed persistence.
 *
 * Both run-persistence.ts (workflow runs) and workflow-saved.ts (saved
 * workflow commands) persist plain-JSON records to per-record files under a
 * project/user directory, and both need the same three guarantees:
 *
 *  1. Atomic writes with a recovery backup — a crash mid-write must never
 *     corrupt the live file, and a later-discovered-truncated primary must
 *     still be recoverable from the last good write.
 *  2. Corrupt-file recovery on read — a truncated/corrupt primary falls back
 *     to its `.bak` sidecar instead of losing the record.
 *  3. A missing or unreadable directory degrades to "no files" rather than
 *     throwing — a listing must never crash because one storage location is
 *     temporarily inaccessible (not yet created, deleted mid-race, EACCES).
 *
 * This module is the single implementation of all three; run-persistence.ts
 * and workflow-saved.ts both call into it rather than maintaining parallel
 * copies.
