/**
 * Bundled workflow commands: `/deep-research`, `/adversarial-review`,
 * `/multi-perspective`, `/code-review`, and `/codebase-audit`.
 *
 * Each command starts its generated workflow through the WorkflowManager's
 * background path — the command returns immediately, progress is visible in
 * the task panel and `/workflows` (pause/stop work like any managed run), and
 * the report is delivered back into the conversation on completion by
 * installResultDelivery. Running inline in the handler instead would block the
 * whole session until the workflow finished (#104).
