/**
 * Model tier configuration for workflow subagent model routing.
 *
 * A tier is a named slot (small/medium/big) holding exactly ONE model spec
 * string (e.g. "openai/gpt-4.1-mini" or "openai-codex/gpt-5.5:xhigh").
 * When an agent() call specifies opts.tier, that single model is resolved with
 * Pi CLI-style parsing and used as the subagent's model/thinking level (unless
 * an explicit opts.model is given, which always wins — see agent.ts).
 *
 * This augments the phase-pattern routing in model-routing.ts: phase routing
 * maps workflow phases → models via the script's meta; tiers give scripts a
 * coarse, user-configurable small/medium/big knob that is independent of any
 * concrete provider/model id.
